## Deployment
This application is deployed on Render's free tier, which may result in slower performance due to the cold start process. Free-tier servers are put to sleep after periods of inactivity (around 30 minutes), and waking them up can take approximately 30 seconds. This may cause the app to load more slowly initially.

If the site doesnâ€™t appear on the first click, please wait for about 30 seconds and try again, as the server may be waking up.
The deployed link is present in the About section of the project.
